Coisir Lunnainn is a friendly, non-auditioned choir, and we welcome
          all levels of Gaelicâ€”whether you are a native speaker, a learner
          or you're just keen to give it a go.

We rehearse on Tuesday evenings, and have made these hybrid
          online/in-person rehearsals since March 2020, allowing all past and
          present members to connect, no matter where they are in the world.
