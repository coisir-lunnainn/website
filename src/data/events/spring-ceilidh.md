Còisir Lunnainn (the London Gaelic Choir) and Comunn Gàidhlig Lunnainn (the Gaelic Society of London) invite you to celebrate Seachdain na Gàidlig (World Scottish Gaelic Week) with us! This year’s theme for Seachdain na Gàidlig is Ceanglaichean gun Chrìch, which signifies “Building Connections” in English. And what better way for us to build connections with London’s Gaelic speakers and learners, and the wider community of London-based Gaels (whether by heritage or spirit) than with a concert of Gaelic music and a ceilidh dance!

Starting at 6.30pm, Còisir Lunnainn will perform a short selection of Gaelic songs, including ones where audience participation is strongly encouraged! Then its time for ceilidh dancing, with the amazing Lochnagar ceilidh band accompanying us. Don’t worry if you don’t know your Dashing White Sergeant from your Gay Gordons; there will be a caller to talk you through the dances and help everyone take part. And – of course – it wouldn’t be a ceilidh without a raffle. By the end of the night, you should be walking away with a smile on your face, a new pal or two and (if you are lucky) a prize.

Air a mhaoineachadh le Seachdain na Gàidhlig tro Mhaoin nan Tabhartas Beag, le taic bho Bhòrd na Gàidhlig // Funded by Seachdain na Gàidhlig’s Small Grants Fund with support from Bòrd na Gàidhlig.

Seachdain na Gàidhlig 2025 will take place from 24th February - 2nd March 2025. For a full list of events running throughout the week and information on how to get involved, visit: www.seachdainnagaidhlig.scot.
