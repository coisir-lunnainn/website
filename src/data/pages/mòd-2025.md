# Mòd 2025

Còisir Lunnainn was thrilled to take part in its centenary Mòd in Loch Aber. Though the choir was founded in 1891, the first Mòd we took part in was the 1925 Mòd in Greenock, when Margrat Duncan herself sang with our main choir and conducted our ladies’ choir.

To celebrate this anniversary, we selected our own choice songs for the Margrat Duncan competition, the Area Ladies’ competition and the Groups of 5–10 Singers competition from the prescribed pieces in 1925.

Members of Còisir Lunnainn took part in a wide range of competitions this year. In addition to the Margrat Duncan, the Area Ladies and the Groups of 5–10 Singers competitions, we had two quartets and six duets taking part in those competitions, as well as 23 Còisir Lunnainn entries in various solo competitions at all levels.
