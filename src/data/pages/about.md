Còisir Lunnainn was founded in 1891 and is proud to be the world's oldest Scottish Gaelic choir. We're a friendly non-auditioned choir, and we're always looking for new members!

We rehearse on Tuesdays at 7:30pm at Crown Court Church hall in Covent Garden, London.

Our motto is "Ceòl—Càirdeas—Cliù", which loosely translates as 'Music—Friendship—Renown', and reflects our core principles of music and friendship, with an additional commitment to sharing our singing more widely.
